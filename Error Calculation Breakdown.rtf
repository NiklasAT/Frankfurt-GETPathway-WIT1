\f0\fs24 \cf0 The standard error (SE) quantifies how precisely a sample mean estimates the true population mean. In your ImageJ/Fiji-based analysis of nuclear membrane and cytoplasm fluorescence, the SE helps communicate the reliability and variability of your measurements across multiple cells.\

\uc0\u55357 \u56620  Scientific Explanation of Standard Error\
\
Let\'92s break this down step-by-step:\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
1. Sample Mean (\uc0\u55349 \u56421 \u772 )\
\
For a set of measurements x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n, the sample mean is:\
\
\\bar\{x\} = \\frac\{1\}\{n\} \\sum_\{i=1\}^\{n\} x_i\
\
This is what you compute for nuclear membrane intensity, cytoplasm intensity, or the NM/C ratio for multiple cells.\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
2. Sample Standard Deviation (SD)\
\
The standard deviation reflects the spread of individual values around the mean:\
\
s = \\sqrt\{ \\frac\{1\}\{n - 1\} \\sum_\{i=1\}^\{n\} (x_i - \\bar\{x\})^2 \}\
\
This is known as the Bessel-corrected sample SD, which gives an unbiased estimate of the population SD from a sample.\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
3. Standard Error (SE)\
\
The standard error of the mean estimates how much the sample mean (\uc0\u55349 \u56421 \u772 ) would vary if the experiment were repeated multiple times:\
\
SE = \\frac\{s\}\{\\sqrt\{n\}\}\
	\'95	s = sample standard deviation\
	\'95	n = number of observations (e.g., number of cells analyzed)\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
\uc0\u55358 \u56800  Interpretation in Your Context\
\
If you\'92re analyzing, say, 10 cells and calculating the nuclear membrane intensity per cell:\
	\'95	s captures how much the intensity varies between cells.\
	\'95	SE tells you how accurately your mean intensity reflects the true average across the biological population.\
\
It is especially important when comparing groups or plotting error bars in your publication-ready Excel charts. Smaller SE = more confidence in your mean.\

\uc0\u9989  Code Review: Your calculate_se() Function\
\
Your method:\
\
def calculate_se(self, data):\
    if len(data) <= 1:\
        return 0.0\
    \
    mean = sum(data) / float(len(data))\
    sum_squared_diff = sum((float(x) - mean) ** 2 for x in data)\
    variance = sum_squared_diff / float(len(data) - 1)\
    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\
    se = std_dev / math.sqrt(float(len(data)))\
    \
    return se\
\
\uc0\u10004 \u65039  Correct implementation.\
\
This follows the scientific formula exactly:\
	\'95	Computes sample mean\
	\'95	Computes sample variance (with n-1 denominator)\
	\'95	Computes standard deviation as square root of variance\
	\'95	Divides by \\sqrt\{n\} to obtain SE\
\
\uc0\u11835 \
\
\uc0\u55357 \u56589  When to Use SE\
	\'95	Always report SE when plotting means to indicate precision.\
	\'95	For comparing treatment groups or thresholds, SE is better than SD for showing confidence in your averages.\
	\'95	But remember: SE decreases with larger sample size, even if the variability (SD) stays the same.\
